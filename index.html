      <h2>What is The Third Man about?</h2>
      <p>
        The Third Man is a movie based on a book of the same name which follows
        the story of an American writer, Holly Martins who is invited across the
        Atlantic ocean to a divided post-World War 2 Vienna by his friend, Harry
        Lime. Holly upon arrival in the divided Vienna, comes to find Harry is
        not at his apartment. According to the keeper of the complex, Lime had
        suffered a terrible car accident at the hands of his own driver.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having flown across the ocean to a promised job, the only business
        Martins had in Vienna was to attend his dearest friends funeral. This is
        where he would meet Major Calloway and his assistant, on top of seeing
        Lime's girlfriend and friends. After meeting and conversing with one of
        Lime's friends, he finds discrepencies between his story and that of the
        keepers. Becoming suspicious of Harry's death, Holly takes it upon
        himself to find out what really happened to Harry Lime.

        Though I would like to continue to tell the tale of The Third Man, it
        cannot be appreciated fully without watching the classic film in its
        entirety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I leave the rest of the story untold to be unraveled by your own
        eyes.
